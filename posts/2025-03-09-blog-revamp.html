        <p>It's been a while, hasn't it? I finally decided to revamp my blog almost 5 years after my previous post. I did say I wasn't going to post as often, but I didn't expect to go this long without posting! I'm not going to promise more frequent updates, but things have been going well lately and I don't intend on allowing my life to be derailed again any time soon.</p>
	<p>You may have noticed that the blog now has a new title. I think it's quite fitting, considering my interests. I'm still dabbling with type systems and I've always liked toucans, even as a child, so it just feels right. Along with the new title, the blog now has new visuals too! It probably shouldn't come as a surprise that those were made by yours truly in Inkscape as SVGs. They're simple visuals, but I think they look nice. If you open a post that is too long to fit on a single page, try scrolling and see what happens!</p>
	<p>With all that out of the way, I really wanted to give an update on how things have been going for me. Last time I posted, there was a pandemic and I took on the duty of running a meetup. As it turns out, I'm still running that meetup to this day! I'm also still running my YouTube channel, though I haven't uploaded any videos for a little while. I have plans to upload something there soon, but it'll be a bit longer before that's out. I kind of pivoted away from gaming related posts on this blog and on my channel, but I'm still very much enjoying video games in my spare time, so I've decided to change my approach a little bit. Instead of avoiding gaming posts entirely, I want to use the tag system to help readers filter out the posts they don't care about. No promises on when these changes will land, but hopefully they'll arrive soon. I've also created a second YouTube channel for non-programming related videos, including gaming videos, which gives me a bit more freedom to share what I want to without polluting my main channel with videos that may not be of interest to my target audience. I didn't call it a gaming channel because I might upload a few other surprises there too.</p>
	<p>You may have noticed that I'm a lot more hesitant to promise anything or talk about future plans now. Over the last 5 years, I've learned a lot about myself and have realised that I'm really bad at keeping promises. I also have a pretty bad habit of telling people my plans and feeling demotivated afterwards, leaving those plans unfinished. While I'm certain that plenty of other people have the same issues, I'd rather hold myself to a higher standard than I used to and just avoid making promises I can't keep. Part of this also means killing projects before they get off the ground to ensure I stay focused on the projects I value most. Anyone who is familiar with my level packs for Leaf's Odyssey probably knows I'm an ideas person, and I can get a bit carried away with starting new projects when I get new ideas. Nowadays, I tend to start new projects, estimate how much effort it'll take to get them off the ground, and kill them if they're not a high enough priority and will take too much time to complete. This has been working pretty well so far and has kept me focused on the few projects that I do value.</p>
