        <p>As it turns out, I just couldn't find the time to work on a real blog post for September. In an effort to try and make some more measurable progress with my mini-rando project, I have started up a new YouTube channel for logging all my work on the project. It can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjQgvE-k654RiRCLXa7JQNw">here</a>. I intend on uploading at least once every weekend, but I will have to see how the scheduling works out.</p>
<p>On that note, I do intend to keep posting to this blog once I have some more substantial content to post. I do have ideas for future blog posts, but it's nice to have something more concrete to present.</p>
