        Over the last few years, I have become more and more drawn in by the
        genre of street photography.  I (unfortunately) do not have enough time
        to practice this as much as I want, but I do try to carry a camera
        around at all times.

        I tend to work around what is &quot;real&quot; and candid, in other
        words, what is really there, on the streets.  Within that framework,
        however, I am fascinated by things that seem unreal, dreamlike and/or
        eerie.
